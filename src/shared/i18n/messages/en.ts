     title: "Built specifically for Saudi real estate & contracting",

   questions: [
    {
     q: "Is Ruwaq really free?",
     a: "Yes. The platform is currently in a fully free launch trial with no limits. Even after that trial ends, a permanent free plan covers a limited number of proposals per month — no card needed to start.",
    },
    {
     q: "Do I need a credit card to sign up?",
     a: "No. Sign-in is via Google only. A payment method is only needed if you later choose to upgrade to a paid plan for higher monthly volume.",
    },
    {
     q: "Can I use my own company logo and details?",
     a: "Absolutely — that's the whole point. Fill in your logo, company name, and commercial registration once in Company Profile, and they appear automatically on every proposal you export.",
    },
    {
     q: "Are the generated proposals legally binding contracts?",
     a: "Proposals and clauses are a strong starting point that save you drafting time, but they are not legal advice. Always review them, and for high-value contracts consult qualified counsel before signing.",
    },
    {
     q: "How is this different from writing it myself in Word or using ChatGPT directly?",
     a: "ChatGPT gives you generic text you have to format yourself from scratch every time. Ruwaq builds a structured, export-ready proposal — scope, timeline, payment terms, and your branding — with no manual formatting or copy-pasting.",
    },
    {
     q: "Is there a limit on how many proposals I can create?",
     a: "During the current launch trial: no limit at all. Afterward, the free plan includes a set number per month, and paid plans offer higher or unlimited volume — see the pricing page for details.",
    },
    {
     q: "How does my client view the final proposal?",
     a: "You send them a direct link (or an exported PDF) — they open it on any device without needing to sign in, and can approve or request changes from the same page.",
    },
    {
     q: "Is my data or my clients' data shared or sold?",
     a: "No. Your data is used only to generate your proposals. Full details are on the Privacy Policy page.",
    },
    {
     q: "Does the platform support both Arabic and English?",
     a: "Yes, fully — you choose the language for each proposal when creating it, and the platform interface itself is available in both Arabic and English.",
